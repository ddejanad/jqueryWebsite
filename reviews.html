            This is one of those films you can't help enjoying. It's light, fun, undemanding, and an absolute joy to watch. 
            It might not be a gritty urban drama that deals sensitively with youth and alienation in high school, but then neither was "Heathers".
            Cinema primarily exists to entertain, and "Only The Strong" does this in spades. 
            Dacascos is the most graceful, watchable martial arts star since Brandon Lee, with an easy charisma that really comes across in a film like this
             and also the brilliant "Drive". The rest of the cast perform quite nicely as well. The plot and characterisation are admittedly 2-D, but what the hell,
              it's a 100% schmaltz-free feelgood movie. Two of my friends actually took up Capoeira after watching this film. How's that for life-changing?</div>

          The casting and performances by all were outstanding, especially Bautista and Norton, and I really liked the setting
           in Greece, but I feel the ending ruined what could've been a better sequel. There certainly was some creative ideas 
           in the narrative, and even though the start was slow and tedious, it did get better when Benoit Blanc started to unravel
            the mystery. However, the unravelling was too as-a-matter-of-factly and too convenient in its set-up. And normally I'd 
            be fine with that, because the few twists were a nice touch, but then right after the mystery was solved, the ridiculous
             antics just became too unbelievable and quite frankly, unnecessary. Still, and enjoyable one-time watch, especially if
              you enjoyed the first one.</div>

          Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to 
          Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out 
          of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too 
          late.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its 
            self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness.

          In recent years, Hill has tried to branch out on his own with his Directors debut and other various works but with this last project its apparent hes
           incapable of being great while taking the lead. Films like Moneyball and Wolf of Wall Street were great because of good direction, spectacular writing 
           and good lead actors.You People...Screenwriters/Director Kenya Barris and Jonah Hill do a masterful job depicting racism and twisting it into their own 
           definition of comedy. The result? Cringe with a splash of garbage is exactly what this film was.Love Jonah Hill but not when hes taking charge.
           Glad this was free. I just cant get back those precious minutes i could have used to watch paint dry.

          Rare seeing Brad Pitt in a movie like this but from what I understand the director is a good friend of his. It's an action movie the reads like Smoking Aces. 
          An ensemble cast with a few different stories in it, of which, interestingly enough Brad Pitt's story as a man named Ladybug could be considered just as important
           as the others despite being the star.Unlike Smoking Aces, the Bullet Train in itself is a character and a very expensive one that makes it a blockbuster.
            On top of that the very cool Celebrity Cameos that prove this director makes friends with everyone he works with in Hollywood.The Japanese back drop was 
            cool not just because I'm an anime fan but because it made the film and the bullet train visual amazing to look at, but Hollywood needs more Japanese 
            actors who can speak English. Hiroyuki Sanada is become the Danny Trejo of the Far East.Its action packed and its humorous everything I want when watching 
            a movie in theatres.

      I knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only
       reason I was there was to take my daughter to see it is strictly 
       because my wife said there was a short Frozen film that played 
       along with the movie and my daughter just so happens to be the 
       biggest Frozen fan on the face of the planet.Not only was I 
       surprised by Coco, it might be the most in depth best story line 
       I've ever seen in an animated movie. It was also educational and 
       shed an entirely new light on the background of the Mexican 
       holiday Dia De Los Muertos.Wonderful movie, can't say enough good things about it!

          Complements the awfulness of its protagonists' Caucasian camouflage with putrid bathroom humor, pitiable romance 
          and brainless racial/social commentary.
